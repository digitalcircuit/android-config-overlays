    <!-- The display uses different gamma curves for different refresh rates. It's hard for panel
         vendor to tune the curves to have exact same brightness for different refresh rate. So
         flicker could be observed at switch time. The issue is worse at the gamma lower end.
         In addition, human eyes are more sensitive to the flicker at darker environment.
         To prevent flicker, we only support higher refresh rates if the display brightness is above
         a threshold. And the darker environment could have higher threshold.
         For example, no higher refresh rate if
             display brightness <= disp0 && ambient brightness <= amb0
             || display brightness <= disp1 && ambient brightness <= amb1 -->

             round up to 3 since the integer value of the floating point representation isn't an

             Note: on Android 10, the brightness thresholds were 13% = green tint, 15% = fine.
             Android 11 changed the displayed brightness percentage.  This does not impact the
             integer value gotten from the ADB settings command.
             To get the brightness in integer from the UI percentage, use
             adb shell settings get system screen_brightness -->
